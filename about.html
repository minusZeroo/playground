precision_score, recall_score, f1_score is what was improved.

GA: ideal hyperparameters
population size: 20*, 50, 100
crossover_prob = 0.8
mutation_prob = 0.01
number_of_generations = 10*
batch_size, random.choice (10, 32, 64)
epoch=5 or 10

PSO
epochs = 5 or 10 or 20
iters = 10, same as generations in GA
n_particles = the higher the better, make 20, 50, 100. Particles and population are the same

Firefly
n_fireless = 10, 20, 50
max_generations = 10, 15, 20
epochs=10
